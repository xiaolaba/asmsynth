This is audio library and allows you to generate up to 32 voices at the same time. It also allows you to create background music by executing two programs asynchronously. In addition, the H bridge is supported, so you can use it as a speaker amplifier or control the motors.


I had found these via youtube and the excellent demo of how to uses and the purpose of those.
